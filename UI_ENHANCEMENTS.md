# 🎨 UI Enhancements: Futuristic & Modern

The SafeScan QR app has received a major UI overhaul to match a modern, high-tech aesthetic.

## 🌓 Dark & Light Modes

-   **Futuristic Dark Mode**: Deep space blue backgrounds (`#0B0F19`) with Neon Cyan (`#00F0FF`) and Purple (`#BC13FE`) accents. Perfect for low-light environments and giving a "Cybersecurity" feel.
-   **Modern Light Mode**: Clean, crisp off-white (`#F5F7FA`) with Electric Blue (`#2962FF`) accents. Professional and easy to read.
-   **Toggle**: Switch between modes instantly using the sun/moon icon in the Dashboard header.

## ✨ Design Features

1.  **Glassmorphism**: Cards now use semi-transparent backgrounds with blur effects, creating a sense of depth.
2.  **Neon Glows**: Interactive elements and the scanner overlay feature subtle neon glows.
3.  **Dynamic Gradients**: Backgrounds shift subtly based on the active theme.
4.  **Modern Typography**: Using **Google Fonts (Outfit)** for a clean, geometric look.

## 📱 Updated Screens

-   **Dashboard**: New header with theme toggle, glassmorphic stats cards, and updated bottom navigation.
-   **Scanner**: Neon scanning line and overlay that adapts to the theme.
-   **Result Screen**: Dynamic background gradients based on risk level, glowing risk score circle, and themed content cards.
-   **URL Checker**: Consistent theming with the rest of the app.

## 🚀 How to Test

1.  **Restart the App**: A full restart is recommended to initialize the new Theme Provider.
2.  **Toggle Theme**: Tap the sun/moon icon on the Dashboard.
3.  **Scan a Code**: Observe the new scanner overlay.
4.  **Check Results**: See the glowing risk indicator.
